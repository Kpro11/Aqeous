{\itshape This project is a part of the course T\+D\+T4290 customer driven project in the autumn of 2018.}

 \subsection*{Requirements}

We recommend using a 64 bit compiler, specifically M\+S\+VC 2015. You can get this by installing Visual Studio 2015 from \href{https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/older-downloads/}{\tt https\+://visualstudio.\+microsoft.\+com/vs/older-\/downloads/}

We also recommend using Qt version 5.\+11.\+2 or higher, and Qt Creator version 4.\+7.\+1 or higher. Both can be downloaded from \href{https://www.qt.io/download}{\tt https\+://www.\+qt.\+io/download}

\subsection*{Installation instructions}

\subsubsection*{Qt\+AV}


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Download a Qt\+AV version 1.\+11.\+0 64 bit executable installer (not the 1.\+12.\+0 version) from \href{http://www.qtav.org/install.html}{\tt http\+://www.\+qtav.\+org/install.\+html} {\itshape We have tested this with the V\+S2015x64 1.\+11.\+0 version, which we recommend}
\item Install it with default options, i.\+e. with \char`\"{}\+Development Tools and Examples\char`\"{} and to the C\+:/\+Qt\+AV location
\item Go to the install folder and run the sdk\+\_\+deploy.\+bat file
\item In Qt Creator, switch from \char`\"{}\+Debug\char`\"{} to \char`\"{}\+Release\char`\"{}. This switch located in the bottom left, above the run, debug and build buttons
\item Make sure to run qmake before running the project again. It can be found in the Qt Creator status bar at the top, under \char`\"{}\+Build\char`\"{}, and then \char`\"{}\+Run qmake\char`\"{}
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

Alternativly check this link\+: \href{https://github.com/wang-bin/QtAV/wiki/Deploy-SDK-Without-Building-QtAV}{\tt https\+://github.\+com/wang-\/bin/\+Qt\+A\+V/wiki/\+Deploy-\/\+S\+D\+K-\/\+Without-\/\+Building-\/\+Qt\+AV} or build it yourself {\itshape The reason the release option has to be used, and a potential fix is discussed in pr \#1 \href{https://github.com/Kpro11/Aqeous/pull/1}{\tt https\+://github.\+com/\+Kpro11/\+Aqeous/pull/1}}

\subsubsection*{Simulator and stream\+:}


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Follow internal instructions to set up the propiatery simulator that belongs to S\+I\+N\+T\+EF
\item Install Open Brodcaster Software (O\+BS) from \href{https://obsproject.com/,}{\tt https\+://obsproject.\+com/,} make sure to install the 64 bit version
\item In the O\+BS menu bar, go to \char`\"{}\+Profile\char`\"{} and then \char`\"{}\+Import\char`\"{}. Pick the Aqeous/obs/\+Rov\+Sim\+Profile/ folder
\item In the O\+BS menu bar, go to \char`\"{}\+Scene\char`\"{} and then \char`\"{}\+Import\char`\"{}. Pick the Aqeous/obs/\+Rov\+Sim\+Scene.\+json file
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

{\bfseries This does only work on windows} as the simulator only works on windows, and the paths to the different programs are, for now, hardcoded to windows locations

After that you should be good to go. If not, check that O\+BS is properly recording the fhsim window and then check that the settings are set in accordance with this link\+: \href{https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/obs-studio-send-an-udp-stream-to-a-second-pc-using-obs.455/}{\tt https\+://obsproject.\+com/forum/resources/obs-\/studio-\/send-\/an-\/udp-\/stream-\/to-\/a-\/second-\/pc-\/using-\/obs.\+455/}
